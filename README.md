## Project Conventions

How to build a _Digital World_? Okay, we don't start with the _File
Island_, but we own some concepts from the _Digimon Series_.

### Hierarchy

**Note** Project or Subprojects are organized as the _digimons_ within
**village**. Each project may be separated into several repositories
within **island**, **tamer**, and so on.
* **The Toplevel Project itself** is a mystery that sets up all the
  prerequistes of the world.
* **village** is the birth place of _digimons_. Namely it works like
  `src`.
* **digitama** is the egg of _digimons_. Namely it works like
  `libraries` or `frameworks`.
* **island** is the living environment of _digimons_. Namely it works
  like `share` or `collection`.
  - _nature_ defines _digimons_' look and feel.
  - _stone_ stores the ancient sources to be translated.
* **d-ark** is the interface for users to talk with _digimons_. Namely
  it works like `bin`.
* **tamer** is the interface for developers to train the _digimons_.
  Namely it works like `test`.

### Version

Obviousely, our _digimons_ have their own life cycle.
* [X] **Baby I** is the first stage of _digimons_ evolution straight
  from her _digitama_. Namely it's the `Alpha Version`.

### Make Targets

These conventions are borrowed from the GUN Make.
* **all**: Building the entire program without generating documentation.
  This should be the default target.
* **install**: Building and installing the program with three
  categories: normal ones, pre-installation commands and
  post-installation commands.
* **install-docs**: Generating and installing documentation.
* **uninstall**: Delete all the installed files and documentation with
  three categories, just like the installation commands.
* **mostlyclean**: Delete all files except that people normally don’t
  want to reconstruct.
* **clean**: Delete all files that are normally created by running make.
* **distclean**: Delete all files that are not included in the
  distribution, even if the makefile itself cannot create these files.
* **maintainer-clean**: Delete all files that can be reconstructed,
  including sources produced by Source Generator such as ’ctangle’ and
  ’cweave’.
* **docs**: Generating documentation. User must manually invoke it.
* **dist**: Creating a distribution file of the source files.
* **test**: Performing unit tests on the source file after building.
* **check**: Performing self tests on the program this makefile builds
  after installing.
* **installcheck**: Performing installation tests on the target system
  after installing.
* **installdirs**: Creating the directories where files are installed,
  and their parent directories.
