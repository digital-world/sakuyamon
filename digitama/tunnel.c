     * if the event in unless becomes ready before bytes can be read.
     * In particular, it should check the event in unless before taking any action,
     * and after any operation that may allow Racket thread swapping.
     * If the read must block, then it should unblock if the event in unless becomes ready.
     *
     * Furthermore, after any potentially thread-swapping operation,
     * it must call scheme_wait_input_allowed, because another thread may be attempting to commit,
     * and unless_evt must be checked after scheme_wait_input_allowed returns.
     * To block, the port should use scheme_block_until_unless instead of scheme_block_until.
     * Finally, in blocking mode, it must return after immediately reading data, without allowing a Racket thread swap.
